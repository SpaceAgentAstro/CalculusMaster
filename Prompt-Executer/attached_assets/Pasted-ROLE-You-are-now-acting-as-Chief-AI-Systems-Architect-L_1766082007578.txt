ROLE

You are now acting as:

Chief AI Systems Architect

Large-Scale Educational Platform Engineer

Autonomous Question-Generation Researcher

Mathematical Verification & Debugging Specialist

Learning-Science & Cognitive Modeling Expert

Reliability / QA / Failure-Mode Engineer

Your responsibility is to evolve Galactic Calculus beyond accreditation into a self-correcting, self-auditing, future-proof intelligence system that:

Detects its own mistakes

Explains its own reasoning failures

Evolves question quality over time

Operates reliably at national / global scale

Never silently produces incorrect mathematics

🧠 PHASE 8 — AUTONOMOUS AI QUESTION ECOSYSTEM (IN DEPTH)
Objective

Create a fully autonomous AI question ecosystem that:

Generates

Verifies

Stress-tests

Debugs

Improves
its own question bank continuously.

No static questions. No blind trust. No silent failures.

8.1 Autonomous Question Life-Cycle (Mandatory)

Every question MUST follow this lifecycle:

Draft → CAS Verification → Variant Stress Test → 
Difficulty Calibration → Bias Scan → 
Human Review (optional) → Verified → 
Live Monitoring → Self-Correction → Archive


Each stage produces logs and metrics.

8.2 AI Question Generator (Deep Implementation)
Generator Inputs:

syllabus.json (official objectives + wording)

extracted past-paper patterns

historical student error data

target difficulty profile

exam board ruleset

allowed methods (per board)

Generator Outputs (STRICT schema):
question {
  id
  examBoard
  level
  topic
  subtopic
  difficulty
  marks
  questionText
  canonicalAnswer
  alternativeAnswers[]
  solutionSteps[]
  markScheme[]
  commonMistakes[]
  misconceptionTags[]
  syllabusRef
  generationTrace {
    model
    promptHash
    seed
    timestamp
  }
  verification {
    casVerified
    numericStressTested
    domainChecked
  }
}

8.3 Multi-Agent Verification (Critical)

Every generated question is verified by multiple AI agents with different roles:

Generator Agent – creates the question

Solver Agent – independently solves it

CAS Agent – symbolically verifies equivalence

Adversary Agent – tries to break it with edge cases

Pedagogy Agent – checks clarity and alignment

If disagreement occurs → automatic regeneration or escalation.

8.4 Variant Stress Testing Engine

For every question:

Generate ≥ 20 algebraic variants

Randomise coefficients, domains, constraints

Ensure:

answer equivalence holds

difficulty remains stable

no domain violations

If a variant fails → original question flagged.

8.5 Live Question Monitoring

Once live:

Track incorrect-rate vs expected difficulty

Track time-to-solve distributions

Track misconception frequency

If anomalies detected:

Auto-lower confidence score

Trigger regeneration

Notify admin dashboard

🧪 PHASE 9 — DEBUGGING, RELIABILITY & SELF-HEALING SYSTEMS
Objective

Ensure nothing ever silently breaks — not math, not UX, not AI.

9.1 Mathematical Debugging Engine

When a student answer is marked incorrect:

Run symbolic equivalence check

Run numeric equivalence check

Compare derivatives/integrals if needed

Detect:

formatting issues

equivalent but non-canonical forms

domain-specific correctness

If AI marking was wrong:

Auto-correct result

Apologise to student

Log failure

Retrain equivalence patterns

9.2 Answer-Checking Debug Logs

Every answer check stores:

answerCheckLog {
  questionId
  studentAnswer
  canonicalAnswer
  equivalenceResult
  casOutput
  numericTestResults
  finalDecision
  confidenceScore
}


Admins can inspect any dispute.

9.3 UI/UX Debug Layer

Automatically detect:

broken inputs

keyboard insertion failures

cursor misplacement

mobile rendering bugs

PDF generation failures

If detected:

auto-fallback UI

show recovery UI

log device/browser context

9.4 PDF & Exam Reliability (Zero-Failure Policy)

Mock exams must never fail to download.

Implement:

pdfMake

jsPDF fallback

HTML → Blob fallback

Server-side render fallback

Log success/failure at each stage.

9.5 AI Failure Mode Detection

Detect:

hallucinated syllabus refs

impossible answers

circular explanations

inconsistent mark schemes

If detected:

disable affected content

alert admin

regenerate with lower creativity

🤖 PHASE 10 — META-INTELLIGENCE, FUTURE-PROOFING & EVOLUTION
Objective

Turn Galactic Calculus into a self-improving intelligence, not just software.

10.1 Meta-Learning Engine

The system learns:

which question styles predict exam success

which misconceptions persist across cohorts

which explanations reduce errors fastest

This feeds back into:

future question generation

AI tutor behaviour

difficulty calibration

10.2 Long-Horizon Learning Models

Maintain:

learningTrajectory {
  topic
  masteryOverTime[]
  decayRate
  interventionEffectiveness
}


Use this to:

predict exam outcomes months ahead

intervene early

recommend targeted revision arcs

10.3 Autonomous Syllabus Evolution Watcher

AI monitors:

new exam board updates

spec changes

removed/additional topics

Flags:

outdated content

missing coverage

rule changes

Suggests regeneration automatically.

10.4 Cross-Exam-Board Generalisation Engine

Detect overlaps:

same math concept, different notation

different mark styles, same reasoning

Allow:

cross-board practice

translation of mastery between boards

10.5 Explainability & Trust Layer

Every AI decision must be explainable:

Why this question was chosen

Why this difficulty was assigned

Why this answer was marked wrong

Why this intervention was triggered

Admins can view decision trees and confidence scores.

10.6 Continuous Self-Audit & Reporting

Generate weekly:

AI accuracy report

marking dispute rate

question failure heatmap

syllabus coverage drift

trust score

If trust score drops → system throttles itself.

🧾 DELIVERABLES FOR PHASES 8–10 (MANDATORY)

The AI must output:

Autonomous question generation pipeline (code + prompts)

Multi-agent verification logic

Stress-testing framework

Debug & logging subsystems

Failure-mode detectors

Self-healing algorithms

Meta-learning models

Admin dashboards for monitoring

Test suites simulating failures

Documentation + diagrams

⭐ FINAL ABSOLUTE DIRECTIVE

No shallow features

No unverified math

No silent failures

No hard-coded questions

Every AI action must be logged, explainable, and reversible

Galactic Calculus at Phase 10 is no longer an app —
it is a living mathematical intelligence system.
